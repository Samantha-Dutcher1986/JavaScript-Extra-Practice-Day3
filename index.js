TASK 2 ðŸš€
// look at the code below and explain in your own words where the variable 'count' is available. 
// Explain why 'count' is initialized with a let and not a var or const. 
// Explain how initalizing the variable 'count' with a var would change it's scope
*/

  let count = 0;

}
//'Count' is initialized with a let because let allows you to declare a variable that is limited to the scope of a block statement whereas var defines the variable globally.
//Since 'count' is initialized with let it becomes block scoped, meaning it only exists and is accessible inside of the curly braces and cannot be access outside of them. If var were used it would be globally scoped and accessible both inside and outside of the curly braces.

TASK 3 ðŸš€
* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding - When .this is not inside of a declared object it defaults to the global(window) object.
* 2. Implicit Binding -  When dot notation is used. Whatever is to the left of the dot become the context for this inside of the function
* 3. New Binding -  When the 'new' keyword is used as a contructor, .this is bound to the new object that is created.
* 4. Explicit Binding - When you use add.whatever() the first param is what .this is bound to. Call can take in any number of params. Apply works almost the same way except it can only take in 2 params. Both call and apply are invoked immediately. The parameters in bind() are the same as call() butit is not invoked immediatlely. Instead, bind() returns a function where .this is already bound (making it useful when you don't know all of the arguments beforehand).
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above

  Object oriented design is commonly used in video games.  For this part of the assignment you will be implementing several constructor functions with their correct inheritance hierarchy.

  At the bottom of this file are 3 objects that all end up inheriting from Humanoid.  Use the objects at the bottom of the page to test your constructor functions.
  
  Each constructor function has unique properties and methods that are defined in their block comments below:
